                <p>
                    Research engineer and formal-methods specialist with 10+ years of experience building industry-grade static analysis tools for memory safety, information-flow security, and constant-time verification of cryptographic implementations.

                <p>
                    At CEA List (France), I had a major contribution in research on side-channel security of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), including systematic timing-leak analysis of NIST Post-Quantum Digital Signature Scheme (PQDSS) candidates and developing scalable constant-time verification tools applied to classical and emerging PQC primitives. This work will be presented at the NIST PQC Standardization Conference in 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously, I developed separation-logic-based verifiers at National University of Singapore, National Institute of Informatics (Japan), and University of Tokyo, with tools used in autonomous-driving software and open-source library security projects.

                            <p>The PQDSS standardization process requires cryptographic primitives to be free from vulnerabilities, including timing and cache side-channels. Resistance to timing leakage is notoriously difficult to achieve. This paper reports on a systematic study of timing leakage in the NIST PQDSS candidates, based on a new methodology and its implementation in a new tool called TIMEX. We analyze all NIST Round 1 submissions, for a total of 13 schemes. We report 5 previously unknown vulnerabilities, and we confirm 3 vulnerabilities previously reported in the literature, for a total of 8 vulnerable schemes out of 13. We also provide a detailed analysis of the results, and we draw some lessons learned for the design of future secure cryptographic implementations.</p>

                            <p>Various program verification problems for functional programs can be reduced to the validity checking problem for formulas of a fixpoint logic. Recently, Kobayashi et al. have shown that the unfold/fold transformation originally developed for logic programming can be extended and applied to prove the validity of fixpoint logic formulas. In the present paper, we refine their unfold/fold transformation, so that each predicate can be unfolded a different number of times in an asynchronous manner. Inspired by the work of Lee et al. on size change termination, we use a variant of size change graphs to find an appropriate number of unfoldings of each predicate. We have implemented an unfold/fold transformation tool based on the proposed method, and evaluated its effectiveness.</p>

                            <p>Verification of memory safety such as absence of null pointer dereferences and memory leaks in system software is important in practice. O’Hearn’s group proposed a new method of memory safety analysis/verification by modular abstract interpretation with separation logic and biabduction. To realize this method, one has to construct a call graph before the modular abstract interpretation. This paper aims to analyze/verify memory safety of system software written in C programming language by this method, and as the first step this paper provides a function pointer eliminator tool to eliminate function pointer calls in order to construct a call graph. The tool uses SVF for pointer analysis. First C programs are translated into LLVM programs by Clang and then SVF analyses the LLVM programs. The tool given in this paper finds correspondence between function pointer calls in C programs and those in LLVM programs, and transforms the C programs into C programs with the same functionality and without any function pointer calls.</p>

                            <p>Information Flow Control (IFC) is important to ensure secure programs where secret data does not influence any public data. The pervasive standard that IFC aims to is non-interference. Current IFC systems are separated into dynamic IFC, static IFC, and hybrids between static and dynamic. With dynamic IFC suffering from high overhead and limited ability to prevent implicit flows due to the paths not taken, we propose a novel modular static IFC system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first modular static IFC system. Unlike type-based static IFC systems, ours is logic-based. The limitation of type-based IFC systems is in the inviolability of static security label declarations for fields. As such, they suffer from transient leaks on fields. Our proposed system uses a Hoare-like logic. It verifies each function independently with the help of separation logic. Furthermore, we provide the proof of correctness for our novel IFC system with respect to termination- and timing-insensitive non-interference.</p>

                            <p>This paper proves the completeness of an extension of Hoare's logic and separation logic for pointer programs with mutual recursive procedures. This paper shows the expressiveness of the assertion language as well. This paper achieves a new system by introducing two new inference rules, and removes an axiom that is unsound in separation logic and other redundant inference rules for showing completeness. It introduces a novel expression that is used to describe complete information of a given state in a precondition. This work also uses the necessary and sufficient precondition of a program for the abort-free execution, which enables us to utilize strongest postconditions.</p>

                            <p>We introduce a complete system of Hoare's logic with recursive procedures. Apt gave a system for the same purpose and showed its completeness. Our system is obtained from Apt's system by replacing the invariance axiom, the substitution rule I, the substitution rule II, and the conjunction rule by the rules (inv-conj) and (exists). Apt suggested without proofs that one could replace them by his substitution rule I, (inv-conj), and (exists) to get another complete system. We prove that the substitution rule I can actually be derived in our system. We also give a detailed proof of the completeness of our system.</p>

                             <p>Reynolds' separation logical system for pointer program verification is investigated. This paper proves its completeness theorem as well as the expressiveness theorem that states the weakest precondition of every program and every assertion can be expressed by some assertion. This paper also introduces the predicate that represents the next new cell, and proves the completeness and the soundness of the extended system under deterministic semantics.</p>

                            <p>In the field of Analog VLSI layout design, large variation of MOS component sizes causes mismatches and reduces the performance and splitting is necessary to reduce the variation. On the other hand, intensity of imposing always varies during fabrication. In this ongoing research, the solutions of above problems are introduced with some algorithm implementations. Two different sizes of components can be split into optimized number of pieces and an algorithm distributes them in an average and symmetrical (better) arrangement such that it can ensure average imposing and the efficiency increases. The computer generated solutions are compared with other possible solutions and proved better.</p>
