# Personal Researcher Website

This is a single-page, professional website template for researchers, inspired by modern academic portals. It is built with HTML, Bootstrap, and a little JavaScript.

Your publication and project data have been pre-populated by scraping the public profiles you provided.

## How to Customize

All content is in the `index.html` file.

1.  **Edit Your Biography:** Open `index.html` and find the section with `id="overview"`. Look for the `<!-- TODO: ... -->` comment and replace the placeholder paragraph with your own biography.

2.  **Update Your Title:** In `index.html`, find the `<aside class="sidebar">` section. Look for the `<!-- TODO: ... -->` comment and replace "Researcher" with your current title (e.g., "Postdoctoral Fellow", "Associate Professor").

3.  **Replace Profile Picture:** In the same sidebar section, find the `<img>` tag and replace the `src="https://via.placeholder.com/150"` with a link to your own photo. You can upload an image to an `images` folder (which you can create) and link to it locally (e.g., `<img src="images/profile.jpg" ...>`).

4.  **Customize Styles:** You can change the colors, fonts, and other visual aspects by editing `css/style.css`.

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

You can host this website for free using GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    *   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new public repository.
    *   The repository name **must** be `your-username.github.io` (replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username).

2.  **Upload Your Website Files:**
    *   From your new repository's main page, click the "Add file" button and choose "Upload files".
    *   Upload all the files and folders from this `researcher-website` directory (`index.html`, the `css` folder, and the `js` folder).
    *   Commit the files.

3.  **Visit Your Website:**
    *   Once the files are uploaded, your website will be live.
    *   Open your web browser and go to `https://your-username.github.io`.

That's it! Your personal researcher website is now live.# phaysaal.github.io
